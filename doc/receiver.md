# Receiver Setup

Next, you should configure the receiver and the host computer. At this point,
you will need the Blockstream Satellite command-line interface (CLI). If you
have not installed it yet, make sure to install it using Python3's package
installer ([pip3](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/)):

```
sudo pip3 install blocksat-cli
```

After that, follow the guide corresponding to your receiver type:
